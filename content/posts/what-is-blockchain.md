### Understand ‘Block’ and ‘Chain’. The structure within the Blockchain.

![chains of blocks of a bitcoin blockchain (illustration)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-blockchain.jpg?id=27044755&width=750&height=451 "illustration of a blockchain")

Perhaps the best illustration to imagine blockchain is as above. Each block is linked through a chain to one another, forming an endless string of chained blocks. Most importantly, these blocks and chains are encrypted in cryptography, in which we name it 'hash' which. Here’s why:



**Block**- In a blockchain, every block stores a set of transaction data encrypted
in a hash. Most notably, it contains the hash of a previous block, and the same
thing repeats block after block until it reaches the first block of the
blockchain, the genesis block. In layman terms, each block contains data of
the previous block which link or chain them together.


**Hash**- One of the most common hashing algorithms used (such as bitcoin) is
the SHA-256, in which it hashes unique blocks of character for every
transaction. At the moment, SHA-256 is the most secured with the near impossible collision of number. When detects any deliberate changes, it will
convert into a completely different set of characters.


‘**Chain**’-The reason for each block having a hash of the previous block is
to avoid tampering with the block data. When we change any data in the present block, its hash will change too. When this happens, the hash on the present now does not tally with the previous block, and the changes will be denied. This shows that blockchain does not tolerate any part of the data to be modified, and the only thing that you could do to possibly change the existing blockchain is to change every previous block in existence, which is infeasible.



## A modern-day notary of transactions, understanding the distributed ledger in a blockchain system



Upon understanding the blockchain's block structure, let’s get into the overview of a blockchain. One of the innovations blockchain provides, as evident in cryptocurrencies, is one can make transactions with anyone in the world without state regulations, 3rd party interventions, or time restrictions. 



There is no doubt that to achieve the three requirements above requires a holistic and meticulous system that has such high demands, wheres at the very least, it has to be compatible enough for people to trust it. 



Here's why the blockchain is so unique. Since there is no higher power governing the transactions, blockchain is run through the consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism is where every transaction is recorded only on a single ledger, and that very ledger will be distributed to every user. What this achieves is that everyone can be on the same page, so there will be no confusion on which ledger to refer to. 



The distributed ledger provides 2 attributes that are needed to ensure its security. 

1. All Transactions that were made will be recorded in the distributed ledger 

2. All transactions must be in the consensus of every user. 



How can a distributed ledger examine the legitimacy of the transactions? It identifies and eliminates defects through cross-checking of all recorded transactions that each member has a copy of ever since the very first transaction. 



In simpler terms, imagine playing monopoly with 3 other friends and the four of you records every transaction individually and separately. After the game, all of you compare the notes of the transaction. 



If you were to cheat, it would be easy to identify since your number does not tally with the combined transaction of all your friends. In contrast, if the balance is tallied, all of you can come to the consensus that the transaction is perfect.





## How do Transactions get into the Blockchain, and who validates them?

We have covered how the distributed ledger records all transactions. One
question that remains is who validates the transactions? In a blockchain
network, the existence of nodes is what maintains and validates the ledger.
Nodes are not a person nor a governing body. Instead, there are forms of
devices such as servers, computers, or laptops that connect to the blockchain
and constantly update and add new information to the blockchain.


Let us look at how nodes work on popular blockchains such as the Bitcoin
network. To simplify, we will focus on a specific node that works on the
creation of new blocks, which goes by the name of ‘miners’.


Mining in bitcoin means solving extremely difficult mathematical questions in
exchange for a reward. With the impression of mining now clear in our heads,
we will now move on to the Proof-Of-Work (PoW) mechanism, where the
"mining" work is done. Proof-Of-Work is essential before validating a block
inside a blockchain, and it is done by miners to race and find the correct
number, which is extremely energy-consuming.



The mechanism of Proof-Of-Work in Bitcoin solves 3 problems: 



**1. The cost of PoW is too high to risk any deliberate tampering** 

Blocks that are found incorrect will be forfeited, even more so plus the competition of competing for other miners that creates genuine blocks, there is no chance of getting your block recognized, hence it's unthinkable to mine faulty while bearing the cost that is deemed to be gone. 



**2. It maintains the quality of the blockchain** 

Setting up the PoW ensures and eliminates all foul blocks. Furthermore, Bitcoin also sets the target number of a block generation time, which is 10 minutes per block, ensuring the length of the block is in control. The difficulty of mining also changes every two weeks (or per every 2016 bitcoins) depending on the speed of the block that is mined to fit in the range of 10 minutes. 



**3. Hacking/ Control Bitcoin is not possible** Suppose if you want to control the entire blockchain, you would need to redo all the Proof of Work that has been done, while racing against other miners to create the longest chain that is still ongoing. Hence, in summary, it is improbable and bypasses any financial resources that can be found.



## The transparency of the distributed ledger, Open yet secured



Wondering how can we get a closer look at the distributed ledger? As a matter of fact, we can! As long as it is a public blockchain (like most cryptocurrencies do), everyone can look at all the blocks and the transaction history in a blockchain. 



In a general sense, the term ‘open source’ when referring to a blockchain is the transparency of the distributed ledger. As we know, due to the consensus mechanism in which the blockchain keeps all records, it is that secure that it allows people to access the transactions but has no way of altering the data.



It is important to know that even though anyone can access a distributed ledger, it remains hard to understand for regular people as the blockchain does not graph or visualize the data. However, what we do have are Blockchain explorer tools such as Blockchain.com and Etherscan that allow users to search and explore data about recently minted blocks or transactions that occurred in a blockchain.

Referring to the image above, on the right you can see the history of transactions being made in real-time while on the left are the blocks that were minted that carry a certain amount of transactions.



## Future implications of Blockchain

Once a blockchain is up and running, it annihilates all the disruptive possibilities that lead to a wrong/ corrupt answer other than the truth itself. It allows people to re-imagine governance without the need for any state or corporate authority, and to truly achieve an uninterruptible flow that is determined democratically by the people and for the people. 



Moving on as we previously discussed the structure and potential of blockchain, it is exciting to imagine how blockchain can be integrated into various industries. To name a few, healthcare sectors, insurance, and banking systems may progress to a great extent through advancing security and transparency.
